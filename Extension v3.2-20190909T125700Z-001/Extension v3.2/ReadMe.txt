The code has been updated as of 9/19/19 and I will try my best to help you follow this however I didn't write the main file so I might make a few mistakes.

The main file you will edit is the JavaScript. The HTML and CSS are basic styling choices with the HTML as the popup. Simply you will see a javascript const called "buttons"
This will define most of the code. The Sample for adding a button is below. The Javascript has some code at the bottom to generate a button automatically. All this is,
just a list of what you need to generate. the name attributes sets the name and as in terms of functionality I did not find a major issue and the name could be anything,
but follow best practices and don't make it anything. Remember to add the commas near the end of the final piece of the argument and quotes around not only the attribute 
but also along with the selector (name, link, image, etc...). Images should NOT be hosted on a server as the load time will become abysmal. The links should include Http
or https and the code at the bottom shouldn't be touched. For more info at each function the JS code should have a few comments.

{
        "name": "Portal", //Declare name of button
        "links": "https://portal.apslearns.org", //Insert link
        "image": "portalFIN.PNG" //Insert button image (All buttons are 
    },
